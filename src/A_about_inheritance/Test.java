//  Inheritance
//  -----------
//  -> The process of acquring the properties of one class(sub class) to other class(super class).
//  -> It represent the IS-A-RELATIONSHIP which is also called parent child relationship.
//  
//  Sub class :->  Subclass is a class which inherits from the other class.
//                 It is also called a derived class, extended class, or child class.
//                 
//  Super class :-> Subclass is a class which  from where a subclass inherits the features.             
//                  It is also called a base class or a parent class.
//                  
//  -> Programmatically we can achieve Inheritance by using extends keyword. 
//  -> Constructors cannot be inherited , rather only variable and methods get inherited.
//  
//  Uses:
//	  • Code reusability.
//	  • We can avoid code redundancy.
//	  • We can achieve Generalization.
//	  • We can indirectly achieve Polymorphism.
//
//   -> In java we have 5 type of inheretance .
//       1. Single level inheritance
//       2. Multi level inheritance
//       3. Hierarchical level inheritance
//       4. Multiple level inheritance
//       5. Hybrid level inheritance
//       
//  1. Single level inheritance
//  ---------------------------
//  -> A sub class having one super class or vice-versa is called Single level inheritance.
//  -> It is recommended to create the object of child class.
//  
//  2. Multi level inheritance
//  --------------------------
//  -> A class acting as a sub class and super class at different level is called as
//     Multi level inheritance.
//  -> It is recommended to create the object of grant child class.
//  
//  3. Hierarchical level inheritance
//  ----------------------------------
//  -> A super class having one or more than one sub class is called Hierarchical level inheritance.
//  -> It recommended to create object of every child class.
//  
//  4. Multiple level inheritance
//  -----------------------------
//  -> A sub class having more than one super class.
//  -> It can achieve through interface.
//  
//  5. Hybrid level inheritance
//  ---------------------------
//  -> Combination of Multiple level inheritance and Hierarchical level inheritance.
//  
//  
//  Note:
//	  => Every class in java automatically extends the Super most class called Object.
//      => Object class has 11 Concrete Methods.
//      => final class cannot have a subclass i.e., Final class cannot be extended.
//      => final variable & final method can be inherited but private method and private variable cannot be
//         inherited.
